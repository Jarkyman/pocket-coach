# Theming (light + dark) – design tokens

Use semantic colors, not “blue500”. Then themes swap cleanly.

Tokens:
bg
surface
surfaceElevated
textPrimary
textSecondary
border
accent
accentMuted
success
danger

Light
bg: near-white
surface: white
textPrimary: near-black
accent: one calm accent (teal/indigo-ish)

Dark
bg: near-black
surface: charcoal
textPrimary: near-white
accent: same hue but tuned for dark

Also: support “System / Light / Dark” in Settings.



# Animation checklist (so you remember while building)

Onboarding chips stagger
Coach cards hero transition into details
Chat message entrance
Paywall spring entrance
Button press scale + haptic
Theme toggle cross-fade (optional)
Keep animations subtle and consistent.
