# Pocket Coach - Project Overview

## 1. The Problem
In today's fast-paced world, individuals constantly seek guidance for personal and professional growth. However, traditional coaching is often:
*   **Expensive**: Hiring a personal coach can cost hundreds of dollars per session.
*   **Inaccessible**: finding the right coach for specific needs (productivity, creativity, business) is time-consuming.
*   **Generalized**: Generic advice from books or videos lacks personal context.

People need a solution that is **affordable, always available, and context-aware**—someone who knows their specific goals and constraints.

## 2. The Solution: Pocket Coach
Pocket Coach is an AI-powered mobile application that provides instant, personalized coaching. It features a library of specialized AI personas (Productivity Coach, Founder Coach, Creative Coach, etc.) that users can chat with anytime.

**Key Value Propositions:**
*   **Context-Aware**: The app stores a user's "Personal Context" (goals, values, challenges), which is injected into every AI interaction, ensuring advice is tailored to them.
*   **Specialized Expertise**: Different coaches have distinct personalities and frameworks (e.g., the "Founder Coach" focuses on lean startup principles, while the "Creative Coach" encourages lateral thinking).
*   **Always On**: Available 24/7 for quick advice or deep-dive planning.

## 3. Target Audience
*   **Ambitious Professionals**: Looking to optimize their workflow and career trajectory.
*   **Entrepreneurs/Founders**: Needing a sounding board for business ideas and strategy.
*   **Lifelong Learners**: Individuals dedicated to self-improvement and skill acquisition.
*   **Creatives**: Writers, designers, and artists seeking inspiration or feedback.

## 4. Monetization Strategy
Pocket Coach utilizes a **Freemium Subscription Model** to balance user acquisition with revenue generation.
